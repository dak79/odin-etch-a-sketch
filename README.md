## Description
This project is part of [The Odin Project - Foundations Path](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).
The goal of this project is to learn about DOM manipulation and a proper use of Google Search and net resources.

## Tecnologies
* HTML 
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Git

## Assignement
* Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.

* Create the divs using JavaScript.

* It’s best to put your grid squares inside another “container” div. There are several different ways to make the divs appear as a grid (versus just one on each line). Feel free to use any or play with each of them: float/clear, inline-block, flexbox, CSS Grid.

* There are multiple ways to change the color of the divs, including: adding a new class to the div or changing the div’s background color using JavaScript.

* Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad.

* Research button tags in HTML and how you can make a JavaScript function run when one is clicked. Also check out prompts.

* You should be able to enter 64 and have a brand new 64x64 grid pop up without changing the total amount of pixels used.

* Push your project to GitHub!

* Extra Credit: Instead of just changing the color of a square from black to white (for example), have each pass through with the mouse change it to a completely random RGB value. Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it so that only after 10 passes is the square completely black.
